### What is this?
This is my starter template for my [Nimja](https://github.com/enthus1ast/nimja), [Prologue](https://github.com/planety/prologue) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) webdev stack.

#### How Helpful?:
- Automatic hot-reloading of nimja templates by first compiling my templates into a dynamic library.
- Has a prologue middleware that checks for changes in my templates and recompiles everything to present the latest changes in the browser automatically.
- Will keep updating this so that I can get upto speed very fast in every webdev project.

#### Future directions:
Once [Tim](https://github.com/openpeeps/tim) is ready, I will start using it instead of Nimja.
